A team project in which a small, yet interesting text-based game is to be developed, with certain specifications.

This project was designed to help students create simple turn-based game using objected oriented design philosophy extended 
from the Java object-oriented coding designs originally learned from the CS141 class.
 
The game design was to bring fun and challenge to the player who enjoys playing simple text-based adventure game. 
This would be achieved through an object-oriented design that allowed for turn-based commands from the players to be inputted to the 
game and have the game react accordingly.


Working on a game from scratch wasn’t a new problem for us, but doing so with a group, and in a grand scale, definitely was. 
Adopting ideas and information off of each other and online resources helped us push our way toward the answer, and having others to help 
with a small problem was very helpful and effective. However, having others work on code also lead to problems. Discrepancies within what 
solution to use and even how it should be implemented arose, but were conquered. In the end, we learned how to collaborate effectively, 
and build something together that we couldn’t have done alone, and there’s something to be proud of in that.
